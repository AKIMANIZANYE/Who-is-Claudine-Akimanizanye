<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;">The reason why i dicided to be a softerware developer</h3>
<p>Since I was in my secondary school after changing my combination from   Bilogy chemistyry and Phyisica  i realized that women in technology are very few and i dicided what not i can be even if most of people said that women are very wek in science i made desicion that i am going in science so that i can make change in my conyrt especially in the world.
	I beleve that women can make change  and change the mind from the previous years where they took women as person in home family by taking care of children and make sure that every thing in the famuily is well it ok  for that but in  this days women they can also take decision as woman and thjat create website and system  that what i want to be and make change in the world  i beleive that  I <em style="color:blue;">change the world</em>
